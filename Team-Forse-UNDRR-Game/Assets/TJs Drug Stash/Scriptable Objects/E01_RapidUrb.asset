  description: "Due to economic growth, the city has expanded rapidly, with many
    high-rise buildings and coastal developments constructed quickly to meet housing
    demands. However, most were built without climate-resilient designs, leaving
    them highly vulnerable to rising sea levels, stronger typhoons, and extreme heat
    waves. Scientists warn that within the next decade, severe climate events could
    make large parts of the city uninhabitable. \n\nGovernment officials must decide
    whether to enforce climate adaptation measures at a high cost or focus on immediate
    economic expansion, risking long-term devastation.\n"
