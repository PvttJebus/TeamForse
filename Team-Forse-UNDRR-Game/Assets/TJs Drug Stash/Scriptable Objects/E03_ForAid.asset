  description: "A neighbouring country, Realplacia, has been struck by a catastrophic
    8.5 magnitude earthquake, leaving thousands dead and critical infrastructure
    in ruins. NGOs and international organizations are mobilizing relief efforts
    and have requested your city\u2019s financial and logistical support to aid in
    rescue and recovery operations.\r\n\r\nHowever, a recent investigate report has
    exposed severe corruption within Realplacia\u2019s government. Past foreign aid
    has been misused for personal enrichment, and there\u2019s no guarantee that
    donated funds will reach the people in need.\r\n\r\nWith limited resources, your
    administration must decide whether to send aid despite the risks or withhold
    assistance, prioritizing domestic stability.\r\n"
