  description: "\r\nThe federal government has recently released a prime plot of
    land back to the city, located in a high-traffic coastal area near the business
    district and beachfront. Due to its strategic location, multiple entities are
    interested in securing the land for vastly different purposes:\r\n\r\n- A powerful
    corporation, Amazon has proposed purchasing the land for $100M to develop a high-end
    commercial and residential complex. This would boost the city\u2019s economy
    but increase population density in a high-risk flood zone.\r\n- The city\u2019s
    top university wants to lease the land to establish a climate research and disaster
    preparedness facility. This would provide critical data to improve disaster forecasting
    but comes with far less immediate financial gain.\r\n"
